<h2> Scenario</h2>
A company is planning to host its web application on a physical server which is connected to the internet. So, they are planning to use a Virtual machine (VM) for the web server and another VM as a Database server. They also plan to use a third VM to host some containers to serve additional services required for this web application. Everything should be protected with a firewall and a virtual switch will be used to assign IP addresses to these VMs. 

Your task is to create a diagram that reflects this scenario. 

<h2> Objective</h2>
The objective of this exercise is to design a virtual network that connects the various virtual components on a physical server hosting the company's application, ensuring secure and efficient communication. You will be using the online version of Figma, a popular design tool which is available for free, to create this virtual network diagram. By now you should have set up a Figma account. If you haven’t done so, go back to the Get started with Figma reading.

<h2>Instructions </h2>
Step 1: Start by creating a new file in Figma by clicking on the “New design file” at the top left. 
Step 2: Download the icons in the provided zip folder. Unzip the folder and upload the images to Figma. To learn more about how to unzip folders visit the 
 Mac  or  Windows support page.
 
Step 3: Draw a rectangle by pressing the R key and label it as physical server. You can always press the T key to type text.

Step 4: Take two VM icons and place them inside the upper half of the rectangle

Step 5: Take another VM icon and place it inside the rectangle but lower down and further away from the other two.

Step 6: Place two containers close to this third VM icon and connect them with lines to this VM because they are hosted inside of it. You can always press the L key to draw a line on Figma.

Step 7: Place that firewall icon inside the rectangle. With what do you think should the firewall be connected? The containers or the VM?

Step 8: Place a virtual switch inside this rectangle. With what do you think it should be connected with? The firewall or the VMs?

Step 9: Place the internet icon on the canvas and connect it to the physical server that is represented by the rectangle.

Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you practiced designing a virtual network that incorporates various components such as virtual switches, VMs, containers, virtual firewalls, and a physical server hosting all the virtual items. This hands-on experience should help you understand how network components work together to create a secure and efficient network infrastructure to host a web application with virtual components
