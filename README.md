<h1> Virtual Network Simulation</h1>


<h2> Description of scenario</h2>
A company is planning to host its web application on a physical server which is connected to the internet. So, they are planning to use a Virtual machine (VM) for the web server and another VM as a Database server. They also plan to use a third VM to host some containers to serve additional services required for this web application. Everything should be protected with a firewall and a virtual switch will be used to assign IP addresses to these VMs. The task is to create a diagram that reflects this scenario. 

<h2> Objective</h2>
The objective of this exercise is to design a virtual network that connects the various virtual components on a physical server hosting the company's application, ensuring secure and efficient communication. You will be using the online version of Figma, a popular design tool which is available for free, to create this virtual network diagram. By now you should have set up a Figma account. If you havenâ€™t done so, go back to the Get started with Figma reading.

<h2>Instructions </h2>
Step 1: Start by creating a new file in Figma.

Step 2: Download the icons in the provided zip folder. Unzip the folder and upload the images to Figma. Label each picture for clarity.

Step 3: Draw a rectangle by pressing the R key and label it as physical server.

Step 4: Take two VM icons and place them inside the upper half of the rectangle

Step 5: Take another VM icon and place it inside the rectangle but lower down and further away from the other two.

Step 6: Place two containers close to this third VM icon and connect them with lines to this VM because they are hosted inside of it. You can always press the L key to draw a line on Figma.

Step 7: Place that firewall icon inside the rectangle. Connect the firewall with the three VMs

Step 8: Place a virtual switch inside this rectangle. Connect the firewall with the three VPNs.

Step 9: Place the internet icon on the canvas and connect it to the physical server that is represented by the rectangle.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
In this exercise, I successfully designed a virtual network diagram using Figma to reflect the company's plan to host its web application on a physical server connected to the internet. The diagram includes three virtual machines (VMs) designated for the web server, database server, and hosting containers for additional services. Each VM is protected by a firewall, and a virtual switch is used to assign IP addresses. By following the provided instructions and utilizing the downloaded icons, I created a clear and organized representation of the network architecture, ensuring secure and efficient communication among the virtual components.
